# Welcome to Karthi's Digital Garden! ðŸŒ±

I read quite a few papers and textbooks for my research work and I've always been overwhelmed by the density of information in them. To help me collate and revise the material better, I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Once the database started growing, I wanted to release it to the world so other people can (maybe) benefit from it. Hence this project.

A book I'm currently reading: [[Dynamic Field Theory]]

The [[Research]] note is a good place to start exploring this garden as it is one of the most backlinked-to notes. Also check out the [[Graph]], which is also available at the bottom of every note.

Topics:
[[Articles]] [[Books]] [[Research]] [[Videos]]

Recent:

[[Neuroscience and Neuromorphic Engineering]]

[[Mosaic - Reconfigurable small world networks]]

[[Legendre Memory Units]]
