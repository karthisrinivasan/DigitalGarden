### Balfour Declaration was a controversial document in West Asian history. Elaborate.
-   Only spoke about civil, religious rights
-   Sympathetic to Zionists at expense of existing citizens
-   Point was to get American and Russian Jews to help GB in WWI
-   Palestine buffer between GB and French territories
-   By helping the Zionists establish a national home in Palestine, the British could claim to be aiding self determination while imperially setting up shop in Palestine.
-   Arabs neglected
-   State of Palestine or Protectorate _in_ Palestine? "national home" had no precedent in intl. law
-   No geographical boundaries
-   Extremely ambiguous
-   Non-recognition of Palestinians
-   Tacitly acknowledges barren-land narrative
-   Stories/travelogues of Palestine depicted a barren land
    -   Mark Twain (1867) visited and wrote 'Innocence Abroad' 
-   >90% of population indigenous (non-Jews)

- ambiguous as balfour
- territories not clear
	- some vs. all
