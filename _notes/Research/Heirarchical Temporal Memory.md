## Hierarchical Temporal Memory
- [[Ideas+Thoughts]]: Implement this in CMOS ??
- [[Jeff Hawkins]]: [[A Thousand Brains]]
- Store, infer, recall high-order sequences
- Constant learning of time-based patterns in unlabeled data
- Spatial patterns identified and memorized
- Versions:
	- zeta1
	- cortical learning
	- sensorimotor inference
- Functional model, primarily
- Still has differences when compared to neurons
	- strictly binary signals and synapses
	- no direct inhibition of synapses or dendrites (but simulated indirectly)
	- currently only models layers 2/3 and 4 (no 5 or 6)
	- no "motor" control (layer 5)
	- no feed-back between regions (layer 6 of high to layer 1 of low)
