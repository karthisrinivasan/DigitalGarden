[[Research]] [[Neuromorphic]]

- SNNs for Control 
- Stereo vision 
- 99+% MNIST with direct training of SNNs
- Neuromodulation
	- Same network, multiple tasks
- Sigma-Delta based on LIF ?
- CNN-SNN conversion a la Diehl
- Basic control flow using neurons -> for loops, if statements
- Legendre Delay Networks
- Learning on activations instead of synapse for short term (working memory)
