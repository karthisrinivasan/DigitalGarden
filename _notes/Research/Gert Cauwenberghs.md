- Ongoing Research: Trainable Reconfigurable Development Platform for Large-Scale Neuromorphic Cognitive Computing
	- The large-scale neuromorphic platform will serve as a new and unparalleled resource to the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) research community, addressing a great need for an experimental testbed for research in alternative forms of computing beyond the traditional von Neumann paradigm and the impending physical limits to Moore's Law expansion in the scaling of computing technology. 
	- The reconfigurable platform will feature a hierarchically interconnected network of in-memory computing processing nodes that emulates, in real-time, highly flexible neural dynamics (integrate-and-fire, graded, stochastic binary, etc) of up to 128 million neurons with high flexible connectivity and plasticity (spike-timing dependent plasticity, gradient-based deep learning, etc) of up to 32 billion synapses. 
	- The system will be capable of biophysical detail in computational neuroscience modeling, as well as high performance and efficiency in on-line adaptive pattern recognition, serving and bringing together both computational neuroscience and computational intelligence communities that have traditionally pursued disparate computational approaches.
