# Hyperacuity
[[Neuroscience]]

- Spatial distinctions on scales much smaller than resolution of vision
- Detection of misaligned edge much smaller than receptor array spacing
	- ![[Pasted image 20210601182841.png]]
- Sub-pixel resolution
- Due to graded (analog) intensity response but single spatial value
	- Similar to how mean of histogram can be calculated to smaller than a bin-width
- Exact neural apparatus unknown: [[Ideas+Thoughts]]
	- Hypotheses:
		- Spatial - based on population firing rates
		- Temporal - delays in response to miniature eye movements
	- No empirical support yet
- Hexagonal matrix provides optimum efficiency of information transfer
- Other senses
	- Braille reading - hyperacuity in touch receptors
	- Hearing - many more tones than number of hair cells in cochlea
	- Echolocation in bats
	- Rodents localization using whiskers
