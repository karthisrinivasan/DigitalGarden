## Dynamic Neural Fields
- Population-based models of dynamics
- Used for large homogeneous populations
- Modeling elementary cognitive functions in humans
- Implementing cognitive representations for robots

### Implementation
- WTA connectivity network
- Each neuron: 
	- Positive recurrent connection to itself and few nearest neighbors
	- Inhibitory connection to rest of network (global)
		- Relayed through inhibitory population
	-
