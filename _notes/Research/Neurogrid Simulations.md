# Neurogrid simulates cortical cell-types, active dendrites, and top-down attention

[[Research/Kwabena Boahen]] 

AER has reached limit -> bus signaling rate = traffic offered by network
Neurogrid minimizes wiring, hierarchical distribution and aggregation

## Hierarchical distribution and aggregation
- Hierarchical replication by axon -> distribution
- Branch points close to terminal -> minimal wiring
- ![[Pasted image 20210614153155.png]]
- Bouton cluster - extend multiple branches to meet terminal branch of axon

## Active Dendrites
- NMDA spikes sharpen sensory tuning
- NMDA spike occurs when above some threshold, a small increment of synaptic strength more than doubles the amplitude of the EPSP, which then remains unchanged for further increments

- EPSP, back-propagating action potentials amplify correlated sensory and motor signals
- When a back-propagating spike coincided with a PSP, Na conductance activated and increased the dendriteâ€™s voltage further

- Active dendrites enhance sensorimotor processing

## Top-Down Attention
- NMDA receptors could account for multiplicative changes in spike rate in visual cortical neurons during selective attention

- Heterogeneity causes dendrites to cross threshold at different drives
