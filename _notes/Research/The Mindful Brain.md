# The Mindful Brain: Cortical Organization and Group-Selective Theory of Higher Brain Function
- Vernon Mountcastle

## Introduction
- Local cortical columns: qualitatively similar in all areas
- Golgi I and Golgi II neurons make up minicolumns
- Columns - distributed self-similar systems
- Primates have more cells/column
- Agrees with selectionistic theory
- Consciousness may arise from re-entrant signaling 
	- Continually confirms or alers theory of the self by sensro/motor io


# Organizing Principle for Cerebral Function: Unit Module and Distributed System
## Phylogenetic Development
- No intrinsic differentiation in neocortex regions
- Neocortex development correlates best iwht evolutionar achievement
- Neocortex neurons per linear path (i.e. from layer 1 to last layer) constant across the brain, across species
- Packing density differs

## Ontogenetic development
- Cortical cells arranged in radially oriented cords/columns
- Single clonal derivative

## Cytoarchitectural Differences
- Funcitonal differences
- How realted are cytoarchitecure, extrincisv conex, function
- Reflect patterns of extrinsic connections
- No differences in intrinsic strucutre
- Differnrece may reflect selection of sets of modules by sets of io connections

## Cortical Column
- Vertical arrays
- Densely connected vertically, sparsely connected horizontally
-
