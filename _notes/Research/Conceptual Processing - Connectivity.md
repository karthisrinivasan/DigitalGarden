# Task-Dependent Functional and Effective Connectivity during Conceptual Processing
- [[Neuroscience]] 

## Introduction
- Modality-specific regions the norm
	- loosely defined
- Definitions:
	- "Perceptual-motor modalities": include sensorimotor channels as well as internal perception
	- "Cross modal": integrate information from two or more modalities into more abstract representations
	- "Amodal region": Anterior temporal lobe(ATL) 
- Modality-specific and multimodal areas interact in task-dependent manner during conceptual processing

## Refined Model of Conceptual Processing Neural Architecture

- Low-level modality-specific representations converge onto more abstract modality-specific representations in unimodal convergence zones. 
- Multimodal convergence zones integrate information across modalities, while retaining modality specific information. 
- Finally, amodal areas completely abstract away from modality-specific content. 
- Boxes represent brain regions and connected dots represent individual representational units that converge onto a more abstract representation at a higher level.

- Functional coupling in the conceptual system is extensive and flexible. 
- Modality-specific regions selectively come into play when the knowledge they represent is task-relevant.
- Multimodal PPC dynamically adapts its connectivity profile to task-relevant modality-specific nodes.
- Amodal ATL mainly interacts with other high-level cross-modal convergence zones in a task-dependent fashion.

>Core functions of the conceptual system - conceptual abstraction and task dependency - are best achieved by a hierarchical multilevel architecture composed of a modality-specific layer, an intermediate layer (∼multimodal regions), and a single top-level hub (∼amodal ATL).
