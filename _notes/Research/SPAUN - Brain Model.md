# A Large-Scale Model of the Functioning Brain
[[Chris Eliasmith]] [[Terrence Stewart]]

- 2.5 million neuron system
- visual inputs + physically modeled arm
- Embodied anatomical and physiological constrains
- 8 tasks by same model, without modoficiation
- 28x28 input images
- Semantic POinter Architecture Unified Network (SPAUN)
- Architecture 
	- ![Pasted image 20210707113806.png](Pasted%20image%2020210707113806.png)
- Semantic pointers -> elements of compressed neural vector space
- Action-selection mechanism based on spiking basal ganglia

### WM Task

### Coordination
- Unified neural system for learning multiple tasks

### Limitations
- Eye position fixed
- Only digits as input
- Not as adaptive as human brain, can't learn new task
- Limited neuronal variability
- Not all brain areas reflected
