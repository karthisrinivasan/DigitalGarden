### Where to Live?
- Low population density
- High precipitation rates 
- Plenty of wild/native land
- Difficult access by other populations. Once it is obvious that we are on shtf mode, immigration will increase dramatically to better locations. This point helps mitigate this, so point 1 is maintained.
- With climate projections that show fairly neutral changes to habitability (or even favorable). 
- Currently with a decent economy, so enough money can be made to buy remote land and slowly prepare it.
- Preferably with hydroelectric plants in the proximity and fertile land.
