### Walden: Henry David Thoreau
- "Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides away, but eternity remains.” 
	- To fish in the river of time—even without catching anything—is no waste. It can be a special kind of reverie.

- Schedule downtime
	- Make the activity a part of your daily tasks
- Give bad habits a monetary cost
	- Make a conditioned negative response, basically
	- Hourly wage vs. time wasted
