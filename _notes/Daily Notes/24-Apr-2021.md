Landauer, Principle of Erasure: Erasing info results in heat dump + entropy increase. Demon is an information processing machine. Stores and erases when making decision on particle. This storing and erasing compensates for entropy loss.

Basically transformed to Fourier domain, ran through deep net, transformed back. Nets approximate operators if shallow. Demonstrated on simple smooth PDEs so far.
