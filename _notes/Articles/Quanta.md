# Constructor Theory
- Chiara Marletto, David Deutsch
- [[Physics]] [[Research]] 
- Setting impossibility constraints => new phenomena
	- limiting speed of light => time dilation, length contraction etc.
- Goal: Rewrite laws of physics in terms of these impossibility statements: counter-factuals
- Constructor: thing that can perform task then retain capacity to perform it again
	- like catalysts
	- eg. conservation of energy is the counter-factual; perpetual motion machine is the constructor
- Gravity must be quantized: tests proposed
- Interoperability: if entanglement is generated locally through a medium, the medium has to be quantum
- Can define von Neumann's [[Universal Constructor]] in terms of these laws
- What are the laws underlying the distinction between life and non-life [[Ideas+Thoughts]]
-  My best attempt at explaining constructor theory is that it posits that the laws of nature distinguish between what is possible and what not. And the best way to describe this may be, not with an initial condition and an evolution law, but with macroscopic objects—the _constructors_—that can perform certain tasks, but not others. What matters about those constructors is not what they are made of, but what they can and can’t do. Energy, for example, can neither be created nor destroyed—we know that this is empirically correct to high accuracy. That’s a statement about an impossibility. Or take the fact that quantum mechanics does not allow us to perfectly copy the state of a system without destroying the original—another impossibility. Perpetuum mobiles—machines which beat the second law of thermodynamics—are also not possible. Physicists currently treat such impossibilities as a consequence of the laws of nature Constructor theory suggests we instead take them as the starting point: Begin with properties that macroscopic objects can have, then deduce what these objects’ microscopic constituents must be able to do. It’s turning reductionism on its head.

# Brain and the Immune System
- Brain has 'immune privilege' in the body.
	- not under surveillance
	- accidental healthy tissue destruction
	- devastating in brain
- Being disproved in recent times
- Immune activity pushed to borders of brain
- Spotty surveillance in deep regions of brain
- Evolutionary balancing act

# Brain Interfaces
- 1963: Manuel Delgado stops raging bull using brain implant
- Brain does not store information as discrete items categorized logically in a database. Instead, information is encoded as integrated concepts that encapsulate all the sensations, emotions, relevant experiences and significance associated with an item. 
- The words “spaghetti” and “apple” are logically similar in being food items, but each one has a different feel that activates a unique constellation of brain regions.

# Black Hole Beams
- Blandford-Znajek process
- Helical magnetic fields that draw energy out of the black hole
- Spinning BH causes the field lines falling in from the accretion disk to twist
- Magnetic fields form force fields around the BH, keeping accretion disk in place -> Magnetically Arrested Disk (MAD) model (almost confirmed)

# Deep Sea Biosphere
- Serpentinization
	- Chemical alteration of crustal rock through reactions with water
- Deep hydrogen-triggered biosphere
- Microbes use hydrogen and sulfate deep in mines

# Time Crystals
- Original Idea -> Wilczek time crystal
	- Disproved in 2014, just like other perpetual motion machines
- Driven by external source -> Floquet time crystal
	- Set of qubits in some state
	- Absorbs energy from laser to flip state
	- Reverse process then happens
	- Net energy absorbed is zero
- Only discrete time translation symmetry (every period of laser)
