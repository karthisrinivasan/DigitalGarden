Why are they broken all the time?
Deep dive time - potentially something nefarious

Taylor C602:
- 4-hour heat cleaning cycle 
- Dairy-pipes cleansing
- Fails often, nobody knows why
- Employees just say broken
- Time to call the technician
- Really expensive
- Most reliable revenue source (25% of Taylor's revenue)
- Intentionally esoteric and cryptic
- Final cost borne by franchise owners
- Service manual complicated (100 pages)

Kytch: Company that makes add-on to C602 for easy error reports
McDonald's blacklists Kytch

# Longest Border Fence
- 5,600km in Australia
- To keep out dingoes
- 90% of wildlife in Australia unique
- Invasive species introduced during colonization
- Sugar crops infested by beetles; cane toads introduced to counter beetles -> went outta control coz no natural predator
- Dingoes were eating sheep so fenced everything
- But kangaroo population skyrockets coz no dingoes in some areas
- Kangaroos destroy crops and soil quality reduces => desertification

# China's Rush into Africa
- African Union headquarters was bugged for 5 years, by China
- $300 billion invested in Africa so far
- Countries now in debt to China
- Projects contracted, funded and staffed by Chinese 
- Swaziland exception

# Lab Leak Theory
- Spillover hypothesis
	- Wet market, bats, pangolins etc.
	- Actually not a fact, just a hypothesis
	- Became popular coz previous pandemics started sorta like this
- Russian Flu 1977 -> lab leak
- Wuhan Institute of Virology -> working on making coronaviruses more infectious to humans
- Gain-of-Function research -> study more infectious versions to learn 
	- Too risky, not worth it -> scientific consensus
	- Only 3 places in the world
- Lab filling up with coronavirus samples
- Warned by scientists in 2017, 2018 -> lab not safe enough
- Interview with researcher at lab
	- The Batwoman
	- Place of coronavirus density not anywhere near Wuhan

	- SARS broke out here too
	- Thought it was most likely from lab
	- None of the samples in the lab were same as the Covid-19 
		- Not sufficient though for most people
- Australia wanted investigation
	- China retaliates with sanctions
- 3 researchers in Wuhan lab sick with November 2019 -> same symptoms
- Tom Cotton -> not so crazy lol
- WHO Investigation
	- Was led by scientist who had conflict of interest from lab
	- Lot of money in the game
