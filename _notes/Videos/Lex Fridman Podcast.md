## Tomaso Poggio
- Flowers of Algernon story 
- Visual segmentation through motion
- 

## Christof Koch
- Simulation of black hole on computer -> doesn't actually create one
	- Likewise for simulations of consciousness
- Panpsychism
- Consciousness and intelligence don't have to coexist
- The Black Cloud
- Integrated Information Theory
- Solaris, 1972; The Invincible - Stanislaw Lem
- Claustrum 
	- Beneath cortex
	- Projects to and from almost every region of the brain

## David Chalmers
- Hard problem of consciousness
	- consc. as a primitive?
- Not a definition problem (?)
	- How do you define electric charge
- Human vs. robots trolley problem
- Robot civil rights (?)
- Meta-problem
	- Why are we puzzled by consciousness
- Barkley's god vs. Descartes' demon
- Purpose of consciousness

## [[Jeff Hawkins]]
- [[A Thousand Brains]]
- Beginning of intelligence
	- When beings could start moving
	- Moving intelligently has significant advantages
	- No advantage when fixed or floating
	- Mapping environment is tough with neurons
- Learning-of-maps neurons converted into cortical columns 
	- Replicated and became neocortex
	- Grid cells, place cells etc.
- Neocortex is a mapping system
- Dendritic spike -> expectation fed into neuron
- 1000 brains theory -> every column is a prediction mechanism
- Reference frames -> required to predict
	- Hippocampus provides a coarse reference frame for columns
- Columns process information from a sensorimotor system -> could be physical or virtual
- Can create an intelligent system that models the world perfectly but has no human tendencies like will to live etc.
	- Obsolete human tendencies are vestiges of evolution
	- Personal agency/intent won't arise on its own in intelligent machines
- Self-replication is the threat, not intelligence
- Merging brains -> biological problem of recording so many signals, problem of information coding
- Intelligent machines for space exploration
- What kind of signal would last for millions of years -> preserve human knowledge
- Simple theory of the neocortex -> regular, repeating structure
- Everyone should understand something about how their brain works
	- More rational people 
- Wright brothers solved control (steering) of flight, not propulsion
