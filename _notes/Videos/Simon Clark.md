# Cold War and Climate Change
- [[Climate Change]]
- Some sciences were preferred by govt.
- Geo-science one of them
- Hence lot of funding
- 1957-58: International Geophysical Year
- Ability to detect radioactive dust in trace amounts
- Also useful to detect C$^{14}$
- Charles Keeling: First measurements of rising CO$_2$ levels
- Earth Observation Satellites; Ice cores in Antarctica
- Hansen 1988: First Report to Govt.

# Why is Venus so Cold
- Should be much hotter given its CO2 concentration
	- 200,000x Earth's amount
- Atmospheric temperature roughly what it should be -> planetary equilibrium temperature
- Experiences much less warming per ton of CO2
	- Nonlinear process (gain compression)
- Feedback effects like increased water vapor amount in air
- Water vapor biggest uncertainty factor in warming predictions
