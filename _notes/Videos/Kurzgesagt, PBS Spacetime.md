# The Final Border
- [[Physics]]
- Laniakea supercluster
	- Local group
		- Milky Way
- 94% of observable universe out of reach
- 18 billion ly - reachable radius

# Hacking the Uncertainty Principle
- 'Squeezed' light
	- Amplitude and phase are conjugate variables for light
	- Get more precision in phase at the cost of amplitude precision
	- Nonlinear crystal - produces entangled pairs
	- Noise now correlated
	- When subtracted, phase noise now much smaller
- Cost of high amplitude uncertainty
	- Radiation pressure noise
- Other applications
	- Entangled atomic clocks for more accurate GPS


# The Tail End
- 2,000 weeks spent in work
- 5,200 weeks total roughly

# Terraforming Venus
- 460 Celsius surface temperature
- 97% CO2, 37x pressure
- Almost same surface gravity
- Remove atmosphere by blasting it off by superheating or sequestration
	- Or put it in the shade with solar mirror
- At 31 Celsius, CO2 condenses  and rains
- Transport water from Europa (skyhook)
- Frozen CO2 held in place
- Another set of mirrors for controlled heating
- Cyanobacteria to create oxygen in primarily nitrogen environment

# Immune System
- Cut/wound occurs
- Cells send alarm signals
- Macrophages show up
	- Start eating bacteria
- Neutrophils show up next
	- Die few days after being made
	- Careless, collateral damage happens
- Blood vessels dilate
- Complement proteins generated
	- Attach to bacteria and kill them
- Dendritic cell
	- Taking samples of bacteria
	- Enters lymph system
	- Looks for helper T-cell that has recognizes the antigen
	- Immune system has weapon against every bacteria possible
- T-cell starts multiplying
	- 2 groups -> 1 to fight
	- Reactivates macrophages
	- 2nd group activate B-cells
- B-cells multiply and make antibodies
- Immune cells start killing themselves as infection goes down
- Some T-cells become memory cells to remember infection
